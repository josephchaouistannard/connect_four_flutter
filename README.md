## About The Project

This project was essentially for me to learn the basics of Flutter, and to try to better manage a project from idea to release. I wanted to create a more professionally presented repo, and publish a finished (albeit simple) app.

I thought it was important for me to adopt a professional Git workflow, even on a simple solo project.
